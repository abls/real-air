## docs
notes outlining a reverse-engineered understanding of some of the protocol used to communicate with the Nreal Air

start reading [here](docs/README.md)

## code
a demo opengl program whose camera orientation is controlled by the orientation of a pair of Nreal Air glasses

completely standalone from nreal's unity sdk, so this supports any platform you wanna port it to, not just locked into unity games on android

will turn this into a reuseable library and demote the opengl stuff to an example usage of the library, also might write steamvr or monado drivers

```
git submodule update --init
make
./demo
```
